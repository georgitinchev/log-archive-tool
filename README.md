# log-archive-tool
A simple command-line tool to compress and archive logs from a specified directory into tar.gz files. Keeps systems clean by organizing logs in a separate directory while logging the archive date and time. Ideal for practicing file handling, directory management, and building Unix-based CLI tools.
